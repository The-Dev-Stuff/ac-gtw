## Development Guidelines

- Always create a todo file in the root of the project to track your work.
- Use a virtual environment (.venv) for Python projects to manage dependencies.
- Stick to the same terminal session when running commands to maintain context and avoid unnecessary setup.
- Only write documentation or tests when explicitly instructed to do so and keep these tasks separate from development work and very concise.
