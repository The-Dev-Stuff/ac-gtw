## Development Guidelines

- Always create a todo file in the root of the project to track your work.
- Keep documentation minimal and focused on essential information. Do not generate extensive documentation unless specifically requested.
- Use a virtual environment (.venv) for Python projects to manage dependencies.
- Stick to the same terminal session when running commands to maintain context and avoid unnecessary setup.
